# Set in Python 
# Set is the collection of the unordered items.
# Each element in the set must be unique & immutable. 


# nums = {1, 2, 3, 4}
# set2 = {1, 2, 2, 2}
# #repeated elements stored only once, so it resolved to {1,2}

# null_set = set()    #empty set syntax


collection = {1, 2, 2, 2, "hello", "world", "world", 4}

print(collection);
print(type(collection));
print(len(collection))   #total number of items.
